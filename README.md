# pywmctrl
This is limited remake of wmctrl in Python. Started this project long ago because wmctrl
I had available on my distribution was very buggy. This script implements only functionality
needed back then. I had another script dependant on wmctrl output so this one's output is almost
100% compatible (my version is formated better, but well written parsing should swallow it).
